# runs through and configures interfaces on a given host
# the interfce command variable should be set with the correct
# parameters
#
# Right now you can set the following parameters
# access vlan
# switchport mode
# channel-group
# speed 40g
# mlag number
# description
# trunk native vlan
#
# If you want to add the configs you need to set action == add
# If you want to remove the configs you need to set the action == del
#
# So if you want to remove the access vlan make sure you have
# access_vlan set to a value and action set to del.  If the action is del
# then every command that is uncommented and has a value with be removed
# 
# To Run:
# ansible-playbook  config_int_commands.yaml
