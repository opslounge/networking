# Parent playbook to  push vlan configuration out to each of the 3 different 
# playbooks referenced below.  The key here is that each  playbook has its own
# individual host parameter so that should be set the the correct value before 
# the playbook is invoked
#
# This playbook will be invoked in a serial pattern.  Which is to say the core
# config will happen first then dist then nxos devices
#
# To Run:
# ansible-playbook deploy_vlan.yaml
#
# Note you will want to configure the vlan information that is used in these playbooks 
# before the playbook gets invovked.  The group_vars/all file will be the place to look 

#- include: core_vlan_add.yaml
- include: dist_vlan_add.yaml
- include: infra_agg.yaml
- include: create_pg.yaml
